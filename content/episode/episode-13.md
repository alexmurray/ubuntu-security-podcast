## This week in Ubuntu Security Updates {#this-week-in-ubuntu-security-updates}

16 unique CVEs addressed


### [[USN-3816-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3816-2/)] systemd vulnerability {#usn-3816-2-systemd-vulnerability}

-   3 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
    -   [CVE-2018-15687](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-15687)
    -   [CVE-2018-15686](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-15686)
    -   [CVE-2018-6954](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-6954)
-   Episode 12 - original fix for CVE-2018-6954 was incomplete - this includes the complete fix
-   Also includes an update to avoid a possible hang on shutdown in unattended-upgrades - [LP #1803391](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1803391)
    -   During shutdown, systemd is already in the process of shutting down
    -   Then unattended-upgrades runs and it goes and tries to update systemd - which then tries to reexec it - which blocks waiting for it to finish shutting down
    -   Creates a deadlock since systemd is waiting on unattended-upgrades to finish but u-u is waiting on systemd reexec
    -   Fix is to not do reexec if systemd is already in the process of stopping


### [[USN-3825-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3825-1/), USN-3825-2] mod_perl vulnerability {#usn-3825-1-usn-3825-2-mod-perl-vulnerability}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
    -   [CVE-2011-2767](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2011-2767)
-   Old CVE - reported to Debian in 2011, who assigned a CVE internally but didn't go any further with it
-   Recently the original reporter of the vulnerability submitted a patch to Debian to fix it - so vuln was reported to Mitre
-   Now fixed in Ubuntu as well


### [[USN-3801-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3801-2/)] Firefox regressions {#usn-3801-2-firefox-regressions}

-   12 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic

    -   [CVE-2018-12388](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-12388)
-   Firefox update (v63) (Episode 9) had some minor regressions
    -   These were present in the upstream firefox release itself
