## Overview {#overview}

This week we look at security updates for the Linux kernel, SDL 2, ClamAV
and more, plus Alex and Joe talk security and performance trade-offs, snaps
and OWASP Top 10 Cloud Security recommendations, and finally Alex covers
some recent concerns about the security of the Snap Store.

    -   [CVE-2019-0136](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-0136)
-   OOB read in ath6kl driver - possible to trigger remotely from the network - crash, DoS
-   Bluetooth KNOB attack
-   Crashes from malicious USB audio devices:
    -   Infinite recursion when parsing device descriptors (if
        had multiple identical device descriptors could be triggered)
    -   OOB read if specified an invalid input pin
-   OOB read in QLogic QEDI iSCSI driver
-   2 covered in [Episode 46](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-46/)
    -   Possible code execution via a NULL pointer dereference in bluetooth UART
        driver - so if an attacker can map executable code at address zero can
        achieve code execution - in Ubuntu we have mmap\_min\_addr set to a
        non-zero value so this is mitigated by default
    -   DoS in Intel wifi driver - allows a malicious client to knock a peer of
        the network
