### [[USN-4160-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4160-1/)] UW IMAP vulnerability [01:04] {#usn-4160-1-uw-imap-vulnerability-01-04}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco
    -   [CVE-2018-19518](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-19518)
-   University of Washington IMAP toolkit (used by PHP for it's IMAP implementation)
-   Used rsh to implement various operations - wouldn't try and sanitize the
    provided hostname - so if attacker could provide a hostname/mailbox to
    php's IMAP without any validation could execute arbitrary commands on the
    host
    -   Fixed by turning off the rsh based functionality by default in PHP - if
        you still want this you can set imap.enable\_insecure\_rsh but this is
        not advised...

-   Integer overflow -> buffer overflow -> root privesc in binder
-   Reintroduction of Spectre v1 vulnerability in ptrace subsystem - Brad
    Spengler - fixed properly in Linus' tree but not when it got backported
    to the stable tree - two lines of code got reordered - so load of
    possible speculative value occurred \_after\_it had been used - so the
    speculative load barrier had no effect - Ubuntu regularly backports fixes
    from the latest stable tree so we ended up affected as well
    -   <https://grsecurity.net/teardown%5Fof%5Fa%5Ffailed%5Flinux%5Flts%5Fspectre%5Ffix.php>
-   Possible DoS (kernel crash) if users can write to /dev/kvm - by default
    on Ubuntu users don't have this privilege so generally not affected
-   2 different heap based buffer overflows in Marvell Wifi driver ->
    occurred when setting parameters for the driver so could be triggered by
    a local users -> crash, DoS or
    possible code execution

-   SMB based buffer overread if try mounting a share with version specified
    as 3.0 but the share itself is version 2.10 -> parameter size mismatch ->
    read of too much memory -> info disclosure
-   UAF in RSI 91x Wi-Fi driver -> able to be triggered by a remote network
    peer -> crash, DoS or possible RCE
-   ptrace spectrev1 reissue, KVM crash, Marvell Wifi Driver issues from above
-   USB audio issues from [Episode 48](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-48/) (Disco kernel -> now fixed in Bionic
