## Overview {#overview}

This week we look at updates to the Linux kernel in preparation for the 18.04.2 release, plus updates for Open vSwitch, Firefox, Avahi, LibVNCServer and more. We also revisit and discuss upstream changes to the mincore() system call to thwart page-cache side-channel attacks first discussed in [Episode 17](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-17/).

## Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community {#goings-on-in-ubuntu-security-community}


### An update on mincore() {#an-update-on-mincore}

-   In [Episode 17](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-17/) discussed changes to mincore() mitigate page cache side-channel attack
-   Linus Torvalds committed a change to change the behaviour of mincore() to mitigate the vulnerability
-   [Recently reverted that change](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=30bac164aca750892b93eef350439a0562a68647) citing too much breakage to existing users:
    -   In particular Netflix have a use-case where they dump page cache across processes to aid in migration of Cassandra workloads across machines
-   Instead an alternate approach to limit cache residency reporting only to processes which have write access to the particular file in question
    -   ie. so if a process has write access to a file which it has open for writing it will be able to read back from mincore() which pages are mapped in the cache and which are not - so will still work for the Netflix and others case of databases wanting to know which pages are mapped or not from disk
    -   will stop the case of being able to know which pages of shared system libraries etc are mapped and hence stop the original side-channel attack
    -   [patches not yet submitted for mm tree or others but should be soon](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jikos/jikos.git/log/?h=pagecache-sidechannel-v2)
