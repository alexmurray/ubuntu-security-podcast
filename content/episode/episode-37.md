    -   [CVE-2017-2518](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-2518)
-   Mix of various issues, most involving various memory corruption problems
    -   UAFs, DoS (crash), heap-based buffer over-reads (crash -&gt; DoS or
        possible information disclosure), incorrect use of temporary

### [[USN-4021-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4021-1/)] libvirt vulnerabilities {#usn-4021-1-libvirt-vulnerabilities}

-   2 CVEs addressed in Cosmic, Disco
    -   [CVE-2019-3886](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-3886)
    -   [CVE-2019-10132](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-10132)
-   DoS where some APIs in the guest agents could be accessed by read-only
    users - this would cause libvirt to block and cause a DoS
-   Privilege escalation due to insecure permissions on the virt-lockd and
    virt-logd UNIX domain sockets - these are created by systemd unit files
    but were created as world writable - and the daemons don't try and
    authenticate the user - so anyone could use these sockets to potentially
    elevate privileges - so fixed by ensuring the systemd socket definitions
    specify the right mode.

-   1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
    -   [CVE-2019-10164](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-10164)
-   "Stack buffer overflow by setting a password" - authenticated user could
    set their password to a specially constructed value which when processed
    by PostgreSQL would cause it to crash, or possible execute arbitrary code

    -   [CVE-2018-12130](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-12130)
-   [Episode 32](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-32/) covered most recent Intel CPU vulnerabilities (MDS) -
    mitigated by a combination of microcode and kernel updates - this
    provides microcode updates for the Sandy Bridge family of Intel

### [[USN-4030-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4030-1/)] web2py vulnerabilities {#usn-4030-1-web2py-vulnerabilities}

    -   [CVE-2016-10321](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2016-10321)
-   Various issues including:
    -   Possible RCE (was serializing encryption key info into a session
        cookie) which could then be read by an attacker since it also made
        session cookie accessible via an API endpoint
    -   Sample web application used a hard-coded encryption key which could
        also allow attackers to do RCE as they could easily interpose on the
        session
    -   Environment variables were exposed by an example API endpoint which
        exposed host info and so remote attackers could then possibly gain
        admin access
    -   Lacked brute-force password protection as wouldn't reject already
        denied hosts from repeatedly trying
