### [[USN-3853-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3853-1/)] GnuPG vulnerability {#usn-3853-1-gnupg-vulnerability}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
    -   [CVE-2018-1000858](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-1000858)
-   GnuPG includes support for Web Key Directories (WKD) to allow easy discovery of public keys via HTTPS
-   Allows a key to be imported from a webserver -&gt; first need to lookup hostname via DNS SRV
-   Fails to sanitize response - so performs an attacker controlled, arbitrary HTTPS GET request
    -   Attacker needs to construct a malicious SRV record for the domain in question
-   Possible CSRF, content injection etc
-   Thunderbird will automatically use WKD via GnuPG to lookup missing keys so allows easy exploitation


### [[USN-3854-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3854-1/)] WebKitGTK+ vulnerabilities {#usn-3854-1-webkitgtk-plus-vulnerabilities}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Cosmic
    -   [CVE-2018-4437](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-4437)
-   Possible RCE via invalid processing of crafted web content (as usual limited details on WebKitGTK vulnerabilities...)


### [[USN-3855-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3855-1/)] systemd vulnerabilities {#usn-3855-1-systemd-vulnerabilities}

-   3 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
    -   [CVE-2018-16866](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-16866)
    -   [CVE-2018-16865](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-16865)
    -   [CVE-2018-16864](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-16864)
-   "System Down" systemd vulnerabilities
-   Chris Coulson put in a heroic effort and patched quickly - Ubuntu first affected distro to release patched systemd
-   Due to use of variable length arrays on the stack, allows various fields which are attacker controlled to be overflowed
-   If overflow far enough can bypass kernel stack guard pages, and hence corrupt the heap
-   Possible code execution as a result (original advisory contained a PoC for i386 which gained control of the instruction pointer)
-   Can be mitigated via use of the gcc flag -fstack-clash-protection - this is now under review to be used by default in forthcoming Ubuntu releases


### [[USN-3856-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3856-1/)] GNOME Bluetooth vulnerability {#usn-3856-1-gnome-bluetooth-vulnerability}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Bionic
    -   [CVE-2018-10910](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-10910)
-   BlueZ doesn't necessarily make bluetooth device undiscoverable automatically after timeout
-   Hence after enabling discovery would then still be discoverable even though user expectation is that is not anymore
-   Actual bug then is really in BlueZ but now added a workaround in GNOME bluetooth to manually disable discovery


### [[USN-3857-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3857-1/)] PEAR vulnerability {#usn-3857-1-pear-vulnerability}

-   PHP Extension and Application Repository - possible RCE when deserialising via PHP object injection
-   Triggered when unpacking a PHAR (PHP ARchive) - also possible to sneak one into a JPEG so easy to exploit - just need image upload (Wordpress etc)

## Goings on in Ubuntu and Linux Security Community {#goings-on-in-ubuntu-and-linux-security-community}


### New page cache side-channel attack via mincore() {#new-page-cache-side-channel-attack-via-mincore}

-   Discovered by a team of researchers including some of those who found Spectre / Meltdown
    -   <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.01161.pdf>
-   Uses mincore() system call on Linux to determine if pages exist in the page cache or not
-   mincore() returns a bitmask of which pages are mapped in the cache for the requested range
-   Can use this side-channel to either:
    -   determine when a process calls a given function in a shared library (since the library will be mapped at the same address in both the attack and victim process)
        -   need to first evict the given page from the cache which is difficult but authors propose a new efficient mechanism to do this
        -   can then do things like UI redressing etc in response
    -   Or can use this is a covert channel to leak information from one process to another
    -   Can even use over the network to leak information via an innocent webserver etc
-   Paper also describes an efficient cache eviction strategy
-   Linus directly applied a fix (<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=574823bfab82d9d8fa47f422778043fbb4b4f50e>)
    -   This changes the behaviour of mincore() to only report pages which have been faulted into the cache by the calling process
        -   So at best can now observe when a page is evicted from the cache but can't see when another process faults in a page
    -   Breaks user-space API of mincore() and hence some existing programs (as noted in the commit)
        -   Linus' primary rule is to never break userspace BUT in this case as is a security vulnerability this is okay
        -   This might also likely affect other programs that use mincore in Ubuntu etc (fincore, e4defrag, qemu etc)
-   Fix is not in the stable upstream kernel yet as waiting to see what fallout there is and so also has not been applied to Ubuntu kernels yet
-   Also good discussion on LWN <https://lwn.net/Articles/776801/> which highlights other avenues for inferring the contents of the page cache and other possible changes to mincore to protect against this attack
-   Will be interesting to see where this all ends up
