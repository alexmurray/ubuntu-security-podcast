### [[USN-4124-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4124-1/)] Exim vulnerability [00:49] {#usn-4124-1-exim-vulnerability-00-49}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco
    -   [CVE-2019-15846](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-15846)
        -   When doing TLS negotiation, parses the Server Name Indication
            headers - would try and handle escape sequences in this string.
        -   Does so by looking at the character after a backslash to determine
            what escape sequence is (\b etc) and then returns that actual value
            (in string\_interpret\_escape())
        -   This gets called by the function string\_unprinting() which is used to
            translate escaped characters into their proper form in a new string -
            and this will run over the bounds of the original string if it ends
            with a backslash - since string\_interpret\_escape() would assume there
            was contents afterwards to interpret
        -   Qualsys were able to develop a PoC which leverages this OOB behaviour
            into a remote root exploit (since this part of the code runs as root
            and they were able to use a combination of heap corruption and OOB
            writes to get code execution)
        -   Fixed to first check if reached end of string (NUL) before trying to
            handle the escaped character
    -   Able to be mitigated by setting ACLs to deny connections which contain
        a trailing backslash in the SNI field - see [CVE-2019-15846 in the Ubuntu CVE Tracker](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-15846)
    -   Lots of press coverage:

### [[USN-4114-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4114-1/)] Linux kernel vulnerabilities [03:49] {#usn-4114-1-linux-kernel-vulnerabilities-03-49}

-   5 CVEs addressed in Bionic (HWE), Disco
    -   [CVE-2019-3900](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3900)
        -   Infinite loop in virtio network driver - guest VM cause host DoS by stalling vhost\_net kernel thread
    -   [CVE-2019-14284](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-14284)
        -   Divide by zero in floppy driver ioctl() handler (created by default by qemu)
    -   [CVE-2019-14283](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-14283)
        -   Integer overflow and OOB read in floppy driver
    -   [CVE-2019-13648](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-13648)
        -   DoS for PowerPC if user calls sigreturn() with crafted signal stack
            frame - exception and system crash (requires transactional memory to
            be disabled)
    -   [CVE-2019-10638](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-10638)
        -   Kernel tries to randomise IP ID values (used for de-fragmentation of
            IP packets) for connection-less protocols to avoid tracking
        -   Is meant to be random across source + dest address + protocol
        -   But if an attacker can observe traffic to multiple hosts, can infer
            the hashing key used to generate the ID values
        -   And then can associate different streams of packets back to the same
            source host and hence can track devices
        -   Fixed to used an actual random value for the base of the hash and use
            a better hashing algorithm (siphash) for ID generation


### [[USN-4115-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4115-1/)] Linux kernel vulnerabilities [06:42] {#usn-4115-1-linux-kernel-vulnerabilities-06-42}

    -   [CVE-2019-15090](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-15090)
        -   OOB read in debug functions of QLogic QEDI iSCSI Initiator Driver
            (allows to read kernel memory - KASLR defeat?)
    -   [CVE-2019-14763](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-14763)
    -   [CVE-2019-14284](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-14284)
        -   See above (Divide by zero in floppy driver)
    -   [CVE-2019-14283](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-14283)
        -   See above (Integer overflow and OOB read in floppy driver)

    -   [CVE-2019-11599](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11599)
        -   Core dump race ([Episode 41](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-41/))

    -   [CVE-2019-10639](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-10639)
        -   Related to CVE-2019-10638 - since used base address of kernel
            structure in memory as hash base, could allow attacker to infer this
            address and so defeat KASLR
    -   [CVE-2019-10638](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-10638)
        -   See above (IP ID randomisation)
    -   [CVE-2019-10207](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-10207)
        -   NULL pointer address execution (call function pointer which is NULL
            since is not initializated) - Ubuntu defaults to a non-zero
            mmap\_min\_addr value which means can't map a page at 0 address so this
            is just a NULL pointer dereference in default config (otherwise is
            arbitrary kernel code execution)
    -   [CVE-2019-0136](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-0136)
        -   Intel Wifi Driver Tunneled Direct Link Setup (allows devices to
            communicate directly with one-another on the same network without
            going via AP) - flaw allows a peer to cause wifi disconnection (DoS)
    -   [CVE-2018-20784](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-20784)
        -   Infinite loop in CFS schedular - DoS
