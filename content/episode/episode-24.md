## Overview {#overview}

A look at recent fixes for vulnerabilities in poppler, WALinuxAgent, the
Linux kernel and more. We also talk about some listener feedback on
Ubuntu hardening and the launch of Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.


## This week in Ubuntu Security Updates {#this-week-in-ubuntu-security-updates}

18 unique CVEs addressed


### [[USN-3905-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3905-1/)] poppler vulnerability {#usn-3905-1-poppler-vulnerability}

    -   [CVE-2019-9200](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-9200)
-   Heap-based buffer underwrite (index into array using negative index) -
    write into heap memory which preceeds the intended buffer - heap
    corruption - crash -&gt; DoS, possible code execution
-   Found by fuzzing and AddressSanitizer in clang


### [[USN-3906-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3906-1/)] LibTIFF vulnerabilities {#usn-3906-1-libtiff-vulnerabilities}

-   6 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
    -   [CVE-2019-7663](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-7663)
    -   [CVE-2019-6128](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-6128)
    -   [CVE-2018-19210](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-19210)
    -   [CVE-2018-17000](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-17000)
    -   [CVE-2018-12900](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-12900)
    -   [CVE-2018-10779](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-10779)
-   All DoS, one possible code-execution:
    -   Dereference of an invalid address (read from invalid memory location)
    -   Heap buffer overread
    -   2x NULL pointer dereferences
    -   Memory leak
    -   Heap buffer overflow - possible code execution


### [[USN-3907-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3907-1/)] WALinuxAgent vulnerability {#usn-3907-1-walinuxagent-vulnerability}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
    -   [CVE-2019-0804](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-0804)
-   WALinuxAgent used to manage instances of Ubuntu (and other Linux
    distributions) running on Azure
-   Can be used to configure swap space for a given image
    -   would then create a swap file (/mnt/swapfile) BUT would make it world-readable
    -   so any local user could read it - if keys or other sensitive items
        were in memory that got swapped to disk could be read by all
-   Fixed to make this readable only by root and to also correct the
    permissions on any existing swapfile as well


### [[USN-3902-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3902-2/)] PHP vulnerabilities {#usn-3902-2-php-vulnerabilities}

    -   [CVE-2019-9021](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-9021)
    -   [CVE-2019-9024](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-9024)
    -   [CVE-2019-9020](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-9020)
-   See last week's [Episode 23](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-23/) - discussed for Xenial and Trusty - fixed
    now for Precise ESM as well

    time, DoS via mmaping a FUSE-backed file into processes memory
    containing command-line args)
-   Trigger of BUG_ON() in kernel (like assert() for kernel code) due to
    integer overflow from large pgoff parameter to remap_file_pages() when
    used in conjuction with an existing mmap() -&gt; crash -&gt; DoS
-   OOB read in USB driver for Option High Speed mobile devices - would
    read a descriptor from the USB device as a u8 and then index into an
    array with this without checking whether it fell within the array
-   NULL pointer dereference in f2fs driver via use of noflush_merge mount
    option


### [[USN-3908-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3908-1/), [USN-3908-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3908-2/)] Linux kernel vulnerability {#usn-3908-1-usn-3908-2-linux-kernel-vulnerability}
