## Overview {#overview}

For the last last episode of 2020, we look back at the most "popular"
packages on this podcast for this year as well as the biggest
vulnerabilities from 2020, plus a BootHole presentation at Ubuntu Masters
as well as vulnerability fixes from the past week too.

### [[USN-4661-1](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4661-1)] Snapcraft vulnerability [01:36] {#usn-4661-1-snapcraft-vulnerability-01-36}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Xenial (16.04 LTS), Bionic (18.04 LTS)
    -   [CVE-2020-27348](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-27348) <!-- medium -->
-   itszn reported via Launchpad - LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH as generated by snapcraft
    would contain an empty element - so cwd would be included - if an
    attacker can drop a malicious library that will be loaded by a snap
    (eg. libc.so) into your home dir (and since home plug is used by almost
    all snaps - and is autoconnected on non-Ubuntu Core systems) would allow
    the attacker to get code-execution in the context of any snap
-   Fixed in snapcraft - as part of the snap USN notification service -
    notified all affected snap publishers just need to rebuild their snaps
    and users will get protected via snap refresh


### [[USN-4656-2](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4656-2)] X.Org X Server vulnerabilities [04:20] {#usn-4656-2-x-dot-org-x-server-vulnerabilities-04-20}

-   2 CVEs addressed in Trusty ESM (14.04 ESM)
    -   [CVE-2020-25712](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-25712) <!-- medium -->
    -   [CVE-2020-14360](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-14360) <!-- medium -->
-   [Episode 99](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-99/)


### [[USN-4662-1](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4662-1)] OpenSSL vulnerability [04:34] {#usn-4662-1-openssl-vulnerability-04-34}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Xenial (16.04 LTS), Bionic (18.04 LTS), Focal (20.04 LTS), Groovy (20.10)
    -   [CVE-2020-1971](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-1971) <!-- high -->
-   NULL pointer dereference when comparing two GENERAL\_NAMEs with an
    EDIPARTYNAME - so if an attacker can cause this they can cause a crash ->
    DoS in any application which uses openssl for TLS handling etc - this can
    be done if an attacker can get a client to check a malicious cert against
    a malicious CRL - and since some apps auto-download CRLs based on URLs
    presented in the cert itself this is not an unreasonable scenario - hence
    high priority as the attack complexity is not high in this case


### [[USN-4663-1](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4663-1)] GDK-PixBuf vulnerability [05:53] {#usn-4663-1-gdk-pixbuf-vulnerability-05-53}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Focal (20.04 LTS), Groovy (20.10)
    -   [CVE-2020-29385](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-29385) <!-- medium -->
-   infinite loop when handling crafted LZW compression code in gifs -> DoS


### [[USN-4664-1](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4664-1)] Aptdaemon vulnerabilities [06:31] {#usn-4664-1-aptdaemon-vulnerabilities-06-31}

-   2 CVEs addressed in Xenial (16.04 LTS), Bionic (18.04 LTS), Focal (20.04 LTS), Groovy (20.10)
    -   [CVE-2020-27349](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-27349) <!-- medium -->
    -   [CVE-2020-16128](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-16128) <!-- medium -->
-   Kevin Backhouse from Github reported via Launchpad
-   aptdaemon provides dbus API for installing packages - provides an
    InstallFile method to install a local .deb - and uses policykit to ensure
    that unprivileged users cannot use this to install packages - however,
    that check only occurs **after** the deb has been parsed - so if there were
    vulns in the parsing (which is provided by apt itself) - since aptd runs
    as root could use these to get RCE - fixed by moving auth checks to occur
    before parsing anything


### [[USN-4665-1](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4665-1)] curl vulnerabilities [08:32] {#usn-4665-1-curl-vulnerabilities-08-32}

-   4 CVEs addressed in Xenial (16.04 LTS), Bionic (18.04 LTS), Focal (20.04 LTS), Groovy (20.10)
    -   [CVE-2020-8286](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-8286) <!-- medium -->
    -   [CVE-2020-8285](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-8285) <!-- medium -->
    -   [CVE-2020-8284](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-8284) <!-- low -->
    -   [CVE-2020-8231](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-8231) <!-- low -->
-   Various issues:
    -   memory leak in handling of FTP wildcard matchings -> DoS
    -   failure to properly validate OCSP responses
    -   incorrect handling of CONNECT\_ONLY option -> could end up connecting to
        wrong host -> info leak
    -   incorrect handling of FTP PASV responses - server can respond with
        alternate IP address + port to connect to -> could then trick clients
        into doing port-scanning on their behalf or other info gathering etc
