    -   [CVE-2019-10208](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-10208)
-   Disco only - if a database contained super-user defined hash-equality
    operators, could allow attacker to read arbitrary server memory
-   If a function was declared as "SECURITY DEFINER" an attacker could

    EXECUTE permission on the function and then requires the function itself
    to have inexact argument type matching otherwise will be disallowed.
