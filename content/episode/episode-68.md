### [[USN-4134-3](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4134-3/)] IBus vulnerability [04:49] {#usn-4134-3-ibus-vulnerability-04-49}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Eoan
    -   [CVE-2019-14822](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-14822)
-   [Episode 47](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-47/) - implements it's own private DBus server which clients
    connect to - original vuln allowed any user who knew address of this bus
    to connect to it - update fixed this by checking the connecting user was
    the same as the owning user - but caused a regression in Qt clients -
    would fail to be able to properly connect to ibus - was reverted - this
    has seen been fixed by fixing the GDBusServer implementation in libglib2
    since it was actually incorrect - and so now we have re-fixed in ibus
