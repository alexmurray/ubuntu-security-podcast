## Overview {#overview}

This week we look at security updates for FreeTDS, HAProxy, Nokogiri, plus

program.


## This week in Ubuntu Security Updates {#this-week-in-ubuntu-security-updates}

9 unique CVEs addressed

    -   [CVE-2019-11485](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11485)
    -   [CVE-2019-11483](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11483)
    -   [CVE-2019-11482](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11482)
    -   [CVE-2019-11481](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11481)
-   [Episode 51](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-51/)


### [[USN-4172-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4172-1/), [USN-4172-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4172-2/)] file vulnerability [00:58] {#usn-4172-1-usn-4172-2-file-vulnerability-00-58}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Disco, Eoan
    -   [CVE-2019-18218](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-18218)
-   OSS-Fuzz using libFuzzer - heap based buffer overflow of up to 4 bytes in
    the CDF parser when handing vector elements - Composite Document File -
    used in MS Office prior to new zipped XML format - ie. the old .doc /
    .xls etc


### [[USN-4173-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4173-1/)] FreeTDS vulnerability [01:48] {#usn-4173-1-freetds-vulnerability-01-48}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Disco, Eoan
    -   [CVE-2019-13508](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-13508)
-   Felix Wilhelm for Google Security Team - if a server were to downgrade
    the protocol to version 5 and send a UDT type to the client, would cause
    a heap buffer overflow due to mismatch in size - fixed by forcing the
    size to an appropriate value


### [[USN-4170-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4170-2/), [USN-4170-3](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4170-3/)] Whoopsie regressions [02:22] {#usn-4170-2-usn-4170-3-whoopsie-regressions-02-22}

-   Affecting Xenial, Bionic, Disco, Eoan
-   [Episode 51](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-51/) - update caused crash on upload to server due to mismatch in
    size and resulting partial uninitialized variable - fixed to intialize
    but realised this could still potentially crash on big-endian
    architectures so fixed properly by changing size to 32-bit to match
    memcpy()


### [[USN-4171-3](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4171-3/), [USN-4171-4](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4171-4/)] Apport regression [04:07] {#usn-4171-3-usn-4171-4-apport-regression-04-07}

-   5 CVEs addressed in Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Disco, Eoan
    -   [CVE-2019-15790](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-15790)
    -   [CVE-2019-11485](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11485)
    -   [CVE-2019-11483](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11483)
    -   [CVE-2019-11482](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11482)
    -   [CVE-2019-11481](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11481)
-   [Episode 51](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-51/) - regression due to missing change to python code to handle
    new internal API - fixed by updating the API to be backwards compatible


### [[USN-4174-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4174-1/)] HAproxy vulnerability [04:55] {#usn-4174-1-haproxy-vulnerability-04-55}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco, Eoan
    -   [CVE-2019-18277](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-18277)
-   HTTP Request Smuggling attack
    -   <https://nathandavison.com/blog/haproxy-http-request-smuggling>
-   Wouldn't reject messages that specified transfer-encoding without
    "chunked" value
-   Could be combined with http reuse for request smuggling - ie. the ability
    to get an attacker controlled chunk appended to a legitimate request and
    hence the response sent back to the attacker etc - fixed to reject if
    transfer-encoding is used without also specifying "chunked"


### [[USN-4175-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4175-1/)] Nokogiri vulnerability [06:36] {#usn-4175-1-nokogiri-vulnerability-06-36}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Disco, Eoan
    -   [CVE-2019-5477](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-5477)
-   Ruby based parser for HTML/XML/SAS etc with XPath & CSS selector support
    etc
-   Command-injection vulnerability - due to use of the Rexical gem - and
    would need to have code which then calls the undocumented load\_file
    method within the CSS tokenizer with user supplied input for the
    filename - due to use of eval()...


### [[USN-4165-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4165-2/)] Firefox regressions [07:38] {#usn-4165-2-firefox-regressions-07-38}

-   Affecting Xenial, Bionic, Disco, Eoan
-   Upstream Firefox 70.0.1 release to fix a regression in the 70.0 release
    (some pages with dynamic javascript would fail to load - v 70.0 had
    enabled a new next-gen local storage feature which caused issues so this
    is now disabled by default)
