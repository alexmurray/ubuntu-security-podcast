-   [Episode 57](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-57/), [Episode 55](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-55/)

-   Heap based buffer over-flow - crash -> DoS, RCE
-   NULL ptr derefs - crash -> DoS
-   Memory overallocation -> memory based remote DoS


### [[USN-4231-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4231-1/)] NSS vulnerability [03:04] {#usn-4231-1-nss-vulnerability-03-04}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM, Xenial, Bionic, Disco, Eoan
    -   [CVE-2019-17006](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-17006)
-   UBSAN found possible buffer overflow due to failure to check lengths of
    inputs to various functions - so applications using libnss for crypto
    could be vulnerable to buffer overflow


### [[USN-4233-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4233-1/)] GnuTLS update [03:54] {#usn-4233-1-gnutls-update-03-54}

-   Affecting Xenial, Bionic
-   Update marks SHA1 as being untrusted for digital signature operations -
    SHA1 has been broken in theory for a while and 2017 Google showed the
    first SHA1 collision - recently the first chosen-prefix attack was
    demonstrated against SHA1 as well - demonstrated by creating a GPG key
    which can impersonate another
-   As such GnuTLS will not trust SHA1 based digital signatures since these
    can relatively easily be forged now (but not for an arbitrary input)
-   As such libraries / applications which use GnuTLS (libsoup, Epiphany)
    will not trust SHA1 based digital signatures
-   <https://sha-mbles.github.io/>

-   Both issues occur when reading a crafted input file using the sadf

-   Does not automatically replicate ACLs which are set to inherit down a
