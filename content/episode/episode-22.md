## Overview {#overview}

This week we cover security updates including Firefox, Thunderbird, OpenSSL and another Ghostscript regression, plus we look at a recent report from Capsule8 comparing Linux hardening features across various distributions and we answer some listener questions.

## Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community {#goings-on-in-ubuntu-security-community}


### Comparison of Linux Hardening across distributions {#comparison-of-linux-hardening-across-distributions}

-   <https://capsule8.com/blog/millions-of-binaries-later-a-look-into-linux-hardening-in-the-wild/>
-   Analyses binaries from various Linux distributions looking for hardening features (OpenSUSE, Debian, CentOS, RHEL &amp; Ubuntu)
-   Compare kernel configuration vs KSPP recommendations
-   Ubuntu 18.04 ranks highest, due to proactive hardening features baked into toolchain and newer kernel taking advantage of KSPP upstream features
    -   gcc is patched so anyone building on Ubuntu gets these features
    -   build.snapcraft.io too
    -   however is missing stack clash mitigation
-   Plan to add more hardening features for 19.10 (stack clash and control-flow integrity support via gcc) and review kernel options cf. KSPP


### Q&amp;A {#q-and-a}


#### Does numerous bugs and regressions in Ghostscript indicate it is reaching it's EOL? {#does-numerous-bugs-and-regressions-in-ghostscript-indicate-it-is-reaching-it-s-eol}

-   [doc-E-brown via twitter](https://twitter.com/docEbrown1/status/1101452172196163585)
-   Lots of recent focus -&gt; finds bugs
-   ghostscript codebase is old and gnarly and some fixes have been quite invasive
-   Any new code could introduce new bugs - particularly complicated fixes -&gt; creates more bugs (regressions)
    -   (as doc-E-brown suggests, regressions indicate old code-base)
-   Tavis (and others) seem to be looking elsewhere but likely still more bugs to be found
-   Would be great if GS could either be made safer or a safer alternative but no-one is stepping up
-   Sadly No good viable alternative currently
