        content security policy protections, RCE etc
    -   Extensions with all-url permission could access local files

        data - possible command injection -> RCE if user tricked into using
        this on a crafted website

    -   [CVE-2019-3016](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3016)
-   5.3 eoan, bionic hwe
-   2 KVM issues
    -   Nested KVM guest could access resources of parent -> sensitive info
        disclosure
    -   Guest VM could read memory from another guest VM since would sometimes
        miss deferred TLB flushes when switching guests
-   Rest low priority
    -   Memory leaks in various network and other device drivers under
        particular error scenarios - not likely that a local or remote user
        could easily trigger these so hence low priority

-   5.0 "cloud" specific kernel (oracle, aws, gke, gcp etc)
-   Same issues as above just with a couple less of the driver memory leak
    fixes since these were already done in a previous update

-   4.15, bionic and xenial hwe
-   CVE-2020-8832 - Ubuntu Intel i915 specific issue due to previous fix for
    CVE-2020-14615 being incomplete - so not completely mitigated in this
    kernel as expected
-   KVM nested virt bug and various driver memory leak fixes (see above) and
    a NULL pointer deref if a malicious USB device was inserted to the system

-   Thanks to Julian Andres Klode from Foundations
-   Fixes for multiple failures to validate inputs - remote attacker could
    use to obtain, inject or remove info
-   Also includes a change to accept IV of 12 bytes as well as 16 bytes since
    this is what a lo t of other OMEMO clients are using
    -   OMEMO (OMEMO Multi-End Message and Object Encryption) - XMPP extension
        for multiclient E2E - so allows messages to be synchronised across
        multiple clients, even if some are offline
