    -   [CVE-2018-20030](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-20030)
-   Divide by zero and a CPU infinite loop (DoS) for handling crafted exif
    content


### [[USN-4359-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4359-1/)] APT vulnerability [01:19] {#usn-4359-1-apt-vulnerability-01-19}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Xenial (16.04 LTS), Bionic (18.04 LTS), Eoan (19.10), Focal (20.04 LTS)
    -   [CVE-2020-3810](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-3810)
-   Own ar archive handling code
-   Stack buffer OOB read for ar archive members with specially crafted
    names - tried to handle spaces etc in names but if the name was all
    spaces would overrun the name and read past the end of it


### [[USN-4360-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4360-1/)] json-c vulnerability [02:04] {#usn-4360-1-json-c-vulnerability-02-04}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM (12.04 ESM), Trusty ESM (14.04 ESM), Xenial (16.04 LTS), Bionic (18.04 LTS), Eoan (19.10), Focal (20.04 LTS)
    -   [CVE-2020-12762](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-12762)
-   Integer overflow -> OOB write from a large json file


### [[USN-4360-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4360-2/), USN-4360-3] json-c regression [02:27] {#usn-4360-2-usn-4360-3-json-c-regression-02-27}

-   Affecting Precise ESM (12.04 ESM), Trusty ESM (14.04 ESM), Xenial (16.04 LTS), Bionic (18.04 LTS), Eoan (19.10), Focal (20.04 LTS)
-   Upstream fix had a bug where logic for trying to handle integer overflow
    was inverted and so would cause INT\_MAX (2GB) memory to be allocated
-   On machines with a small amount of memory this could exhaust all and
    trigger OOM killer
-   Part of logic of the package is to trigger a rexec of upstart (which
    serialises itself via libjson) - so this could cause upstart to consume
    all memory, get killed to OOM killer and cause fail to boot etc
-   upstart not used as default init on xenial+ and initial update was
    delayed for ESM so only a small number of users would be affected (those
    running 16.04 LTS/xenial who had manually configured upstart as init)
