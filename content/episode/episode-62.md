## Overview {#overview}

This week Alex and Joe take an indepth look at the recent Sudo
vulnerability CVE-2019-18634 plus we look at security updates for
OpenSMTPD, systemd, Mesa, Yubico PIV tool and more. We also look at a
recent job opening for a Robotics Security Engineer to join the Ubuntu
Security team.


## This week in Ubuntu Security Updates {#this-week-in-ubuntu-security-updates}

33 unique CVEs addressed


### [[USN-4263-2](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4263-2/)] Sudo vulnerability [00:41] {#usn-4263-2-sudo-vulnerability-00-41}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty ESM
    -   [CVE-2019-18634](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)
-   See [Episode 61](https://ubuntusecuritypodcast.org/episode-61/) and discussion later in episode


### [[USN-4268-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4268-1/)] OpenSMTPD vulnerability [01:02] {#usn-4268-1-opensmtpd-vulnerability-01-02}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Eoan
    -   [CVE-2020-7247](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-7247)
-   Logic bug caused existing sanity checks on MAIL FROM field to be skipped
    under certain scenarios - so by failing to perform this validation, could
    allow an attacker to input shell metacharacters to obtain command
    execution in smtpd (which runs as root) -> remote root command execution.
-   Fixed to always perform sanity checks on MAIL FROM


### [[USN-4269-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4269-1/)] systemd vulnerabilities [02:06] {#usn-4269-1-systemd-vulnerabilities-02-06}

-   5 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Eoan
    -   [CVE-2020-1712](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-1712)
    -   [CVE-2019-3844](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3844)
    -   [CVE-2019-3843](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-3843)
    -   [CVE-2019-20386](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-20386)
    -   [CVE-2018-16888](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-16888)
-   Heap UAF when handing asynchronous policykit queries and dbus messages -
    could allow possible root privesc
-   Possible sandbox escape through DynamicUser property on services via
    setuid binaries to gain new privileges or created setgid binaries
-   Also DynamicUser services can create setuid/setgid binaries which could
    then be used to escalate privileges after
    -   Both low priority since not many users of DynamicUser services plus
        requires cooperation between the service and a helper so can't be
        directly exploited
-   Memory leak in logind when executing udevadm trigger command
-   Possible to get systemd to kill the wrong process if can write to it's
    PIDFile since the pid specified here is not validated
