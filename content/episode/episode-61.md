## This week in Ubuntu Security Updates {#this-week-in-ubuntu-security-updates}

23 unique CVEs addressed


### [[USN-4259-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4259-1/)] Apache Solr vulnerability [00:50] {#usn-4259-1-apache-solr-vulnerability-00-50}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Xenial
    -   [CVE-2017-12629](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-12629)
-   Enterprise search server based on Lucene with XML/HTTP and JSON APIs
-   Was vulnerable to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack - XML can include a
    reference to another XML resource which might then be fetched - this
    could then be combined with another flaw (use of Config API to obtain
    access to the RunExecutableListener class) to allow remote code fetched
    from the remote XML


### [[USN-4261-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4261-1/)] WebKitGTK+ vulnerabilities [01:44] {#usn-4261-1-webkitgtk-plus-vulnerabilities-01-44}

-   3 CVEs addressed in Bionic, Eoan
    -   [CVE-2019-8846](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-8846)
    -   [CVE-2019-8844](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-8844)

-   Various memory management issues which could be triggered via a malicious
    websites - possible remote code execution as a result


### [[USN-4262-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/4262-1/)] OpenStack Keystone vulnerability [02:13] {#usn-4262-1-openstack-keystone-vulnerability-02-13}

    -   [CVE-2019-19687](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-19687)
-   Keystone provides identity services (client authentication etc) for
    OpenStack
-   credentials API allowed any user with a role on a project to list all
    credentials when enforce\_scope was false - so could view other users
    credentials.
-   Was introduced in keystone 15 so didn't affect bionic or older releases -
    only eoan
