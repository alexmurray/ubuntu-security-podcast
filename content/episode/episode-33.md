    -   2\*NULL pointer dereference
    -   Heap-based buffer overflow
    -   Stack-based buffer overflow
    -   3 different cases of possible infinite loop - CPU DoS


### [[USN-3990-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3990-1/)] urllib3 vulnerabilities {#usn-3990-1-urllib3-vulnerabilities}

-   3 CVEs addressed in Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic, Disco
    -   [CVE-2019-11324](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-11324)
    -   [CVE-2019-11236](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-11236)
    -   [CVE-2018-20060](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-20060)
-   When validating certs for HTTPS, could specify a set of certs to validate
    against - however it would always include the system CA certs as well -
    so could validate successfully even if cert is not in chain of explicitly
    desired set - fixed to NOT include system certs in this case
-   Possible CRLF injection
-   Would possibly expose HTTP authorization credentials across different
    origin hosts as after authenticating, if being redirected to a different
    origin host, would still include the Authorization header from the old
    host to the new host - fixed by ensuring this defaults to being off

## Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community {#goings-on-in-ubuntu-security-community}


### Clarifications to documentation regarding latest Intel MDS vulnerabilities {#clarifications-to-documentation-regarding-latest-intel-mds-vulnerabilities}

-   <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/SpectreAndMeltdown/TechFAQ>
-   Updated to describe situation when doing virtualisation:
    -   To enable guest to mitigate various speculative execution
        vulnerabilities, need to ensure the guest CPU emulates the various CPU
        features (such as pcid, ssbd etc).
    -   Depends on workloads - if running untrusted code in guests or not etc.
    -   Previously QEMU would define various CPU models such as Broadwell-IBRS
        which would include support for this emulation. However, most of the
        newer features ssbd, md_clear etc are not included in these CPU models.
    -   So instead need to explicitly enable them - this can be done in a few ways:
        -   Can just passthrough host CPU features directly - recommended
            approach if NOT going to migrating guests across hosts (since if has
            different features will cease to work)
        -   Otherwise manually enable features directly as a subset of the
            supported features from all the various hosts in your datacenter -
            depending on whether using QEMU on the command-line or libvirt to
            configure has different ways to specify this but same idea for both


#### Security Team plans for 19.10 development cycle {#security-team-plans-for-19-dot-10-development-cycle}

-   19.10 cycle roadmap meeting was held in Lyon a 2 weeks ago - each Ubuntu
    team presented on the progress etc from the 19.04 cycle as well as their
    plans for the 19.10 cycle
-   Security team highlights for 19.10:
    -   Automate more parts of our processes around triage of code reviews,
        reactive package updates etc
    -   Review and incorporate KSPP recommendations for kernel hardening
    -   GCC -fstack-clash-protection and -fcf-protection as default
    -   Various snapd enhancements (daemon user, OpenGL support, audio
        migration)
    -   AppArmor features - prompting, more groundwork for fine-grained network
        mediation
