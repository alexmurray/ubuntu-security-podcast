## Overview {#overview}

This week we look at 29 unique CVEs addressed across the supported Ubuntu releases, a discussion of the Main Inclusion Review process and recent news around the bubblewrap package, and open positions within the team.


## This week in Ubuntu Security Updates {#this-week-in-ubuntu-security-updates}

29 unique CVEs addressed


### [[USN-3756-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3756-1/)] Intel Microcode vulnerabilities {#usn-3756-1-intel-microcode-vulnerabilities}

-   3 CVEs addressed in Trusty, Xenial, Bionic
    -   [CVE-2018-3640](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-3640)
    -   [CVE-2018-3639](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-3639)
    -   [CVE-2018-3646](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-3646)
-   Intel microcode updates to address L1TF, Spectre Variant 4 and Rogue System Register Read (RSRE)
-   Intel initially released this with a brand new license which included terms around disallowing benchmarking and possibly preventing redistribution via the Ubuntu mirrors
    -   As a result, we couldn't provide updated microcode packages to full address L1TF etc
    -   Intel have now reverted back to the license used on previous microcode packages and so this can now finally be released
-   <https://perens.com/2018/08/22/new-intel-microcode-license-restriction-is-not-acceptable/>


### [[USN-3755-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3755-1/)] GD vulnerabilities {#usn-3755-1-gd-vulnerabilities}

-   Popular image manipulation and creating library used by PHP and therefore in many PHP web applications
-   Issue in handling of signed integers in GIF decoder allows an attacker to enter an infinite loop and cause DoS via a specially crafted GIF file
-   Double free in JPEG decoder could allow a user to possibly execute arbitrary code via specially crafted JPEG file

-   Fixes issues around handling of data from untrusted servers and image decoding
    -   Usual failure to validate inputs, off-by-one, integer signedness confusion and incorrect freeing of dynamically allocated memory style issues

## Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community {#goings-on-in-ubuntu-security-community}


### MIR Process and bubblewrap {#mir-process-and-bubblewrap}

-   Security team is responsible for doing security audits of packages which are proposed to be included in the main section of the Ubuntu package repository
    -   Packages in main are officially maintained, supported and recommended so deserve a high level of scrutiny before promotion into main
    -   Security team historically only provides security updates to packages in main as well
    -   So we have to be confident we can maintain and support a given package
-   To perform the security review we look at a number of things:
    -   The code is evaluated to determine how easy or not it would be to maintain
    -   The package itself is evaluated to look for potential issues
    -   Code is then evaluated to look for potential existing security vulnerabilities
-   This can be a time consuming process, especially to do well
-   Recently this was in the news, when Hanno BÃ¶ck (infosec journalist and
    researcher) and Tavis Ormandy (GPZ) raised the issue of lack of bubblewrap
    support for gnome desktop thumbnailers
    -   bubblewrap provides support for sandboxing processes via namespaces and the
        use of it to sandbox desktop thumbnailers was introduced in the GNOME 3.26
        release
    -   It was planned to be supported for Ubuntu 18.04, but to do this the package
        had to be moved from universe into main, hence a MIR
    -   Due to shifting priorities, the security team was not able to get this done
        in time and hence the feature had to be disabled
    -   This MIR is being proritised now so this security hardening feature should be available in an upcoming release
    -   Security team is also looking at how to strengthen the hardening via AppArmor MAC profiles in addition
    -   Thanks to Hanno and Tavis for giving this greater visibility
