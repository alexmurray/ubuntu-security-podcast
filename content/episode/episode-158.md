### Nimbuspwn [01:46] {#nimbuspwn-01-46}

-   Nimbuspwn -
    <https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/04/26/microsoft-finds-new-elevation-of-privilege-linux-vulnerability-nimbuspwn/>
-   At the end of April Microsoft disclosed some vulnerabilities which
    gathered a lot of [media](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/patch-now-against-linux-nimbuspwn-root-priv-esc-bugs-579295) [attention](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-nimbuspwn-linux-vulnerability-gives-hackers-root-privileges/), leading to a lot of outlets seemingly
    claiming most Linux systems were affected and that this was a high
    severity issue
-   Describes a number of issues in `networkd-dispatcher` which could be used
    to get RCE
    -   directory traversal
    -   symlink race
    -   TOCTOU permissions check race condition
-   However, all relies on being able to have an arbitrary process run under
    the `systemd-network` user (since this user is the only one which can bind
    to the right dbus name `org.freedesktop.network1`)
-   Originally they provided some vague mentions of gpgv plugins and epmd
    running under this user.
-   gpgv plugins are launched by `apt=/=apt-get` during package install /
    upgrade so this sounds like a common scenario that would affect most
    users (instead of say epmd which is the erlang port mapper daemon, so
    unless you are running erland applications you would not be affected by
    that)
-   Looking again though at these gpg plugins running as the `systemd-network`
    user - this is definitely not the case for standard Ubuntu - since `apt` is
    very clear to run them under the `_apt` user account purposefully to
    restrict their privileges
-   After we [questioned](https://twitter.com/marcdeslaur/status/1521467237571383296) Microsoft about this, they amended the blog post to
    then just say they were able to detect several instances of other
    processes running under this user in various customer environments but
    then state that some of these were due to customer
    misconfigurations.
-   So there is no real evidence here that in general Ubuntu / Linux users
    would be affected as all the original media reporting suggested
-   Perhaps these customers were using containers and running processes in
    those where the UID mapped back to the systemd-network user ID on the
    host? This is a common pitfall with containers and something which users
    need to be aware of when deploying containers
-   As such, what appeared to be quite a high priority and [high](https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-warns-nimbuspwn-security-flaws-haunting-linux) [profile](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/patch-now-against-linux-nimbuspwn-root-priv-esc-bugs-579295)
    [vulnerability](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-nimbuspwn-linux-vulnerability-gives-hackers-root-privileges/) in fact is likely more of a bit of a non-issue - whilst it
    could be argued that these are real issues in `networkd-dispatcher` since
    they are not able to be exploited in standard configurations they are not
    a real threat to most users
-   Interesting to note while the blog post has been
    amended, all the various media articles which cited the original report
    have not been updated and still seem to claim that Ubuntu and other
    distros would be affected by this
-   Also interesting to note, Microsoft worked directly with the upstream
    maintainer of `networkd-dispatcher` but didn't involve any downstream
    distros - as suggested by [Julian Andres Klode](https://twitter.com/JulianKlode/status/1521525589529743360) from the Ubuntu Foundations
    team (and upstream apt maintainer) - perhaps Microsoft should have
    pre-disclosed this issue to the [linux-distros mailing list](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros) - if they had
    done so this likely would have been assessed and clarified earlier so
    that Microsoft could have more properly understood the extent of the
    vulnerabilities which they discovered the internet could have avoided
    another brief panic scenario


### What's new in security in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (part 1) [08:05] {#what-s-new-in-security-in-ubuntu-22-dot-04-lts--part-1--08-05}

-   Preview of the first half of blog post which will be published in the
    coming weeks on the various security features which are included in
    Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. This week we will look at enhancements provided by the
    Linux kernel whilst next week we will look at features provided by other
    parts of the distribution.
-   22.04 LTS latest long term support release - 5 years of standard support
    plus 5 years of ESM - total 10 years of support via Ubuntu Advantage
    (free for personal use)
-   Great foundation to use then to deploy services / applications etc and
    know they will be supported for a long time to come
-   Has been 2 years since the last LTS so there are lots of features to
    cover - I will only touch on some of them - if you want a more deep dive,
    check out the [blog](https://ubuntu.com/blog/whats-new-in-security-for-ubuntu-21-04) [posts](https://ubuntu.com/blog/whats-new-in-security-for-ubuntu-21-10) we published for the interim releases
-   Optimised kernels for different platforms
    -   OEM desktops - 5.17
    -   Desktop &amp; server - 5.15
    -   Desktop will get HWE stack by default so in future will get kernel
        version upgrades bringing new features etc whilst server will stick
        with GA kernel for stability
    -   Clouds have their own optimised kernels
-   Hardware specific enhancements
    -   SGX on Intel for secure enclaves
    -   Memory tagging on ARM64 to protect against memory corruption attacks
    -   AMD SEV for KVM to protect guest VM registers from the host
-   Generic kernel improvements
    -   Core scheduling to provide a means to use SMT in the face of various
        hardware microarchitectural side-channel attacks like L1TF and the like
        (this was only partially mitigated in SW/microcode and could still
        potentially affect VMs running across SMT siblings) - so in past had to
        disable SMT to be fully certain were protected - now can use core
        scheduling to specify to the kernel which processes should not be
        scheduled on sibling HTs to avoid these sorts of attack
    -   Kernel stack offset randomisation across system calls
    -   BPF improvements - one of the most popular subsystems in the kernel,
        used not just for tracing and packet filtering but also now BPF LSM and
        more use-cases. However, has also caused a number of security vulns as
        covered previously - now disabled unprivileged BPF by default. Also
        work has been done to try and support signed BPF programs to ensure
        only trusted code is executed as well.
    -   Landlock LSM for application-level sandboxing - like seccomp, Landlock
        allows a process to specify it's own policy so can sandbox itself -
        rather than say traditional MAC systems of AppArmor/SELinux where the
        system admin configures the policy
        -   LSM stacking allows Landlock to be used in conjunction with AppArmor
            for a more defense-in-depth approach
