    -   [CVE-2020-15238](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-15238)
-   Reported to Ubuntu by Vaisha Bernard - worked with upstream blueman devs
    & Debian maintainers to get this resolved - thanks :)
-   Blueman provides a dbus API to spawn DHCP client when doing
    bluetooth-based networking
-   Would not sanitise the provided argument and would pass this directly to
    dhcpcd which supports specifying a script file to run - this gets
    executed as root so is a simple local root-privesc
-   Fixed to change the way the argument is provided to dhcpcd so that it
    cannot pass arbitrary flags
-   Should also note, by default on Ubuntu we use isc-dhcp-client not dhcpcd
    so unless you have manually installed it, this cannot be exploited

## Goings on in Ubuntu Security Community {#goings-on-in-ubuntu-security-community}


### Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy [07:17] {#ubuntu-security-disclosure-and-embargo-policy-07-17}

-   <https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy>
-   How to report an issue to us (LP / security@ubuntu.com)
-   Scope (Ubuntu archive + Canonical software / infrastructure -
    coordination etc)
-   What to expect from us
-   Disclosure timelines (within 1 week after updates provided, prefer
    exploits etc kept private for at least 1 week after fixes available)
-   Safe harbour (welcome research into the software we provide but no active
    probing of Canonical infra/services)


### CITL releases high level details of 7000 defects [09:06] {#citl-releases-high-level-details-of-7000-defects-09-06}

-   <https://cyber-itl.org/2020/10/28/citl-7000-defects.html>
-   7000 defects/vulns across 3243 packages from Ubuntu 18.04
-   Automated static / dynamic analysis system (fuzzing?)
-   Provide list of binaries / packages and the type of 'vuln' (SIG\_SEGV
    etc) - without reproducers etc
-   Expect package maintainers to contact them to request full details
-   Some package maintainers / upstreams will likely contact but we expect
    this to be in the minority
-   Not really possible for @ubuntu\_sec to triage and handle all of these but
    will likely be a collective effort between distros to try and analyse
    these all if CITL are willing to provide details
-   Without a collective effort unlikely that CVEs will get assigned and so
    fixes could be missed if various upstreams just contact and fix these
    themselves
-   Lots of open questions as to how this will play out...
