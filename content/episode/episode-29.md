53 unique CVEs addressed


### [[USN-3947-1](https://usn.ubuntu.com/3947-1/), USN-3947-2] Libxslt vulnerability {#usn-3947-1-usn-3947-2-libxslt-vulnerability}

-   1 CVEs addressed in Precise ESM, Trusty, Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic
    -   [CVE-2019-11068](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-11068)
-   Library to transform XML via XML definitions
-   Includes a security framework since XSLT can define operations to
    fetch/read/write files and resources etc
-   Various functions would return 0 if an operation is not allowed by the
    framework which was checked for and correctly disallowed - BUT they could
    also return -1 on error (say from a potentially bad URL) which would not
    be caught and so then would proceed and would fetch from the URL in
    question thereby violating the security policy
-   Fixed to also check for error codes on handle the same as an explicit
    policy violation
